				    	Born and raised in Germany to Indonesian parents I always had interest in two things: <br> 
				    	1) Tech <br>
				    	2) Exploring (new things to learn & new places to go) <br> 
				    	This brought me into the IT industry as a conusltant and ultimately grew my interest in the processes behind a development to a point where I had to start my own development projects

		    			If you start looking into the question "How do I start developing (anything IT related)?", it is very easy to get overwhelmed. This wasn't different for me. The way I saw it, building my own website was the most approachable attempt to start building something on my own.
